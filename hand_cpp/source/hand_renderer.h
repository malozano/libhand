// HandRenderer
//
// The HandRenderer class sets up a 3D engine used to render the hand. 
//
// The class uses a technique known as PImpl (Pointer to
// Implementation) or "compiler firewalling" to isolate the user from
// the OGRE 3D engine code.
//
// As such the header file does not include any OGRE 3D engine code
// although the hand_renderer class uses it internally in a private
// implementation.
